I received a BE degree at Tsinghua University in 2018 and received a MPhil degree at the University of Sydney in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree at the School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, supervised by [Prof. David Dagan Feng](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dagan-feng.html), [Prof. Jinman Kim](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/jinman-kim.html), and [Prof. Michael Fulham](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/michael-fulham.html). Recently, I also attended the Institue of Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as a visiting scholar, supervised by [Prof. Lei Bi](http://lei.bi/).

My research focus is deep learning for medical image analysis, especially in medical image dense prediction and image-based diagnosis/prognosis. My research projects involve medical image registration, segmentation, and reconstruction, and also multi-modal image-based survival prediction and report generation. 

**I plan to graduate from PhD in early 2025 and am actively looking for academic positions. Please feel free to contact me for any job opportunities or research collaborations!**
