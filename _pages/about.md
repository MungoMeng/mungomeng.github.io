I received a PhD degree at the University of Sydney in 2025. Before this, I received a BE degree at Tsinghua University in 2018 and a MPhil degree at the University of Sydney in 2021. My PhD and MPhil were supervised by [Prof. Jinman Kim](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/jinman-kim.html) and [Prof. David Dagan Feng](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dagan-feng.html). From July 2024, I attended the Institue of Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as a part-time visiting scholar, supervised by [Prof. Lei Bi](http://lei.bi/).

My research focus is deep learning for medical image analysis, especially in medical image dense prediction and image-based diagnosis/prognosis. My research projects involve medical image registration, segmentation, and reconstruction, and also multi-modal image-based survival prediction and report generation. 

**I am actively looking for tenure-track academic positions. Please feel free to contact me for any job opportunities or research collaborations!**
